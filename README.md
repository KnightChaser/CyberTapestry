# CyberTapestry
> An NFT-looking(?) cyber tapestry generator without a pyramid scam.
> It generates **deterministic patterns** from a seed value. Same seed â†’ same pattern.

## Usage

1. Open the web app. (https://knightchaser.github.io/CyberTapestry)
2. Enter a seed (any hexadecimal value).
3. Save or share the result. Mode and block size will be automatically selected, depending on your input.:
   - Copy the URL to share.
     Example: `?seed=abc123` produces the same output for everyone.

## Notes
- Patterns are generated entirely in the browser.
- No server storage or tracking. I'm not interested in that.
- Supports multiple pattern types, including hex tiles, grids, waves, and geometric designs. Please feel free to erTapestry/actio
